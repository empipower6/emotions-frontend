Emotion Analyzer takes in a text input, and then analyzes it to find the predominant emotions in it. It uses the Affect Dictionary that was created by Mark M. Bailey's library. (https://pypi.org/project/NRCLex/)

The affection library consists of the following emotions;

- fear
- anger
- anticipation
- trust
- surprise
- positive
- negative
- sadness
- disgust
- joy
